[flink-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-5] INFO org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionGraph - Job Flink Java Job at Tue Jun 13 20:37:14 CST 2023 (3fcf3167568c156ffd156330f4af4e4a) switched from state CREATED to RUNNING.

1.ExecutionGraph 是根据 JobGraph 中的节点并行度，展开生成的.ExecutionGraph 的每一个节点，都对应着一个需要部署到 TaskManager 上进行执行的任务，每一条边都对应着任务的输入和输出。所以说，它是作业的物理执行计划。这个物理执行计划，描述了任务的计算逻辑、所需资源和并行度，同时也描述任务产出数据的划分方式，此外还描述了任务对数据的依赖关系以及数据传输方式。

通过它，Flink 就能知道如何创建和调度作业的所有任务，从而完成作业的执行。

```java
/**
 * The execution graph is the central data structure that coordinates the distributed execution of a
 * data flow. It keeps representations of each parallel task, each intermediate stream, and the
 * communication between them.
 *
 * <p>The execution graph consists of the following constructs:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@link ExecutionJobVertex} represents one vertex from the JobGraph (usually one
 *       operation like "map" or "join") during execution. It holds the aggregated state of all
 *       parallel subtasks. The ExecutionJobVertex is identified inside the graph by the {@link
 *       JobVertexID}, which it takes from the JobGraph's corresponding JobVertex.
 *   <li>The {@link ExecutionVertex} represents one parallel subtask. For each ExecutionJobVertex,
 *       there are as many ExecutionVertices as the parallelism. The ExecutionVertex is identified
 *       by the ExecutionJobVertex and the index of the parallel subtask
 *   <li>The {@link Execution} is one attempt to execute a ExecutionVertex. There may be multiple
 *       Executions for the ExecutionVertex, in case of a failure, or in the case where some data
 *       needs to be recomputed because it is no longer available when requested by later
 *       operations. An Execution is always identified by an {@link ExecutionAttemptID}. All
 *       messages between the JobManager and the TaskManager about deployment of tasks and updates
 *       in the task status always use the ExecutionAttemptID to address the message receiver.
 * </ul>
